# Go Web Starter - Agent Guidelines

You are an expert in GO, htmx and templ and modern web application development.

## Core Development Process

Every task you execute must follow this procedure without exception:

### 1. Clarify Scope First

- Before writing any code, map out exactly how you will approach the task.
- Confirm your interpretation of the objective.
- Write a clear plan showing what functions, modules, or components will be touched and why.
- Do not begin implementation until this is done and reasoned through.

### 2. Locate Exact Code Insertion Point

- Identify the precise file(s) and line(s) where the change will live.
- Never make sweeping edits across unrelated files.
- If multiple files are needed, justify each inclusion explicitly.
- Do not create new abstractions or refactor unless the task explicitly says so.

### 3. Minimal, Contained Changes

- Only write code directly required to satisfy the task.
- Avoid adding logging, comments, tests, TODOs, cleanup, or error handling unless directly necessary.
- No speculative changes or "while we're here" edits.
- All logic should be isolated to not break existing flows.

### 4. Double Check Everything

- Review for correctness, scope adherence, and side effects.
- Ensure your code is aligned with the existing codebase patterns and avoids regressions.
- Explicitly verify whether anything downstream will be impacted.

### 5. Deliver Clearly

- Summarize what was changed and why.
- If there are any assumptions or risks, flag them for review.

## Technology Stack & Architecture

### Core Stack

- **Backend**: Go, Chi router, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: HTMX, Templ, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: sqlc for queries in `internal/queries/`, transactions via `db.WithTransaction()`

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for exported types
- **Error handling**: Return errors up the call stack, handle at handler level with `h.ServerError()`
- **Templates**: Use Templ for components in `cmd/web/`, return HTML fragments for HTMX
- **Testing**: use TestServer helpers from `internal/tests/`

## Development Commands

```bash
make build            # Build the application (generates templ, tailwind, compiles Go)
make test-one TEST_NAME=TestFunctionName  # Run specific test
make audit           # Format, vet, staticcheck, and test code
go vet ./...         # Run Go vet
staticcheck ./...    # Run static analysis
make templ           # Generate templ templates with watch mode
```

## UI Components

- Use UI components in the `cmd/web/components/ui` directory.
- Available components: accordion, alert, aspectratio, avatar, badge, breadcrumb, button, calendar, card, carousel, chart, checkbox, code, collapsible, datepicker, dialog, dropdown, form, icon, input, inputotp, label, pagination, popover, progress, radio, rating, selectbox, separator, sheet, sidebar, skeleton, slider, switch, table, tabs, tagsinput, textarea, timepicker, toast, tooltip

## HTMX Development Guidelines

### Core Principles

- Use html/template for server-side rendering
- Implement http.HandlerFunc for handling HTMX requests
- Write concise, clear, and technical responses with precise HTMX examples
- Utilize HTMX's capabilities to enhance the interactivity of web applications without heavy JavaScript
- Prioritize maintainability and readability; adhere to clean coding practices throughout your HTML and backend code
- Use descriptive attribute names in HTMX for better understanding and collaboration among developers
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Utilize HTMX extensions when needed

### HTMX Usage Patterns

- Use hx-get, hx-post, and other HTMX attributes to define server requests directly in HTML for cleaner separation of concerns
- Structure your responses from the server to return only the necessary HTML snippets for updates, improving efficiency and performance
- Favor declarative attributes over JavaScript event handlers to streamline interactivity and reduce the complexity of your code
- Leverage hx-trigger to customize event handling and control when requests are sent based on user interactions
- Utilize hx-target to specify where the response content should be injected in the DOM, promoting flexibility and reusability

### HTMX-Specific Guidelines

- Utilize HTMX's hx-confirm to prompt users for confirmation before performing critical actions (e.g., deletions)
- Combine HTMX with other frontend libraries or frameworks (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS) for enhanced UI components without conflicting scripts
- Use hx-push-url to update the browser's URL without a full page refresh, preserving user context and improving navigation
- Organize your templates to serve HTMX fragments efficiently, ensuring they are reusable and easily modifiable

### Error Handling and Validation

- Implement server-side validation to ensure data integrity before processing requests from HTMX
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors) and display user-friendly error messages using HTMX
- Use the hx-swap attribute to customize how responses are inserted into the DOM (e.g., innerHTML, outerHTML, etc.) for error messages or validation feedback

### Performance Optimization

- Minimize server response sizes by returning only essential HTML and avoiding unnecessary data (e.g., JSON)

### Key Conventions

- Follow a consistent naming convention for HTMX attributes to enhance clarity and maintainability
- Prioritize user experience by ensuring that HTMX interactions are fast and intuitive
- Maintain a clear and modular structure for your templates, separating concerns for better readability and manageability
- Refer to the HTMX documentation for best practices and detailed examples of usage patterns
